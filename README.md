# SelfishNetv0.3
Famous SelfishNet program decompiled and inhanced

SelfishNet is Windows Forms application that is used to spoof and monitor network users behaviour and packets, the software can also block network connection for any user IP.

I'm happy to make the code available for developers and to contribute on understanding and making this program really functional.

The code until now is completely miss and needs to be refactored and cleaned.

Requirements:
You need to have WinPcap previously installed.

What have been added:

1- Upgrade to 4.7 .NET Framework.
2- Change Icons.
3- Add auto search when application starts.
3- Improve peformance by using Task instead of using Threads Directly.
4- Fix some bugs the must important one is the high CPU load when disconnected. 
5- Add request for administrator privileges
